# File Focus

Simplify workspace file and folder navigation. Organise the files and folders related to a specific task inside focus groups for easy access and navigation.

As you work on a project you can add files and folders to one or more “focus groups”. You can then quickly navigate folders or open files within a “focus group”.

## Getting Started

1. Expand the File Focus Explorer View.
2. Click the Add Focus Group Icon. Type a name for your focus group.
3. As you work open the context menu in the file explore or editor and select: Add to focus group.

You can open files directly from a focus group. Folders added to "focus group" can be navigated.

### Tips

## Features

- Folders added to a "focus group" can be browsed.
- Create multiple "focus groups" using the add folder icon.
- Rename a "focus group" with the edit icon.
- Delete a "focus group" with the trash icon. Your files and folders will not be touched.
- Add a file or folder to a focus group from the File Explorer Context Menu.
- Files can also be added to a focus group from the editor context menu.
- "ctrl + shit + 8" will add the file in the active editor to a focus group.

## Known Issues

- Only one level of "focus groups" can be created.
- Status changes to files in the file explorer might not be reflected in Focus Groups. As a workaround click the refresh icon in the File Focus Pane.

## Release Notes

This is an early release that is functionally complete.

That means "It works on my machine". Of course, what we want is that the extension works on your machine.
