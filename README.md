# File Focus

File focus is useful when you are working on a large project and want quick access to a set of files and folders that are spread throughout your project.

By creating “Focus Groups” you can re-organise the files and folders in virtual folders.

For example, when working in mono-repo you can organise a subset of files and folders from multiple projects inside a virtual folder for quick access.

## Known Issues

- Only one level of "focus groups" can be created.
- Status changes to files in the file explorer might not be reflected in Focus Groups. As a workaround click the refresh icon in the File Focus Pane.

## Release Notes

This is an early release that is functionally complete.

That means "It works on my machine". Of course, what we want is that the extension works on your machine.
